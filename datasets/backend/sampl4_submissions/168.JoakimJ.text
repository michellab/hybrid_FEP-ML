Hydration free energies computed using the Expanded Ensemble method together with molecular dynamics simulations (EEMD). The solute's geometry was first optimized at a B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory and from this geometry the partial atomic charges were computed by the AM1BCC method using AmberTools.

The force field parameters for the solute were taken from the Generlized Amber force field (GAFF).

The solute was placed in a box of 768 TIP3p water molecules and the energy was minimized, after which a NVT simulation of 100 ps was conducted, followed by a 500 ps NPT simulation at 300 K and 1 atm pressure. The final configuration from the NPT simulation was used for the production EEMD simulations, which were perfomred in the NPT ensemble. 50 subensembles were used and the Wang-Landau algorithm was used to automatically tune the balancing factors and the increamnts were stopped after they reached a value of 0.01 kT. After the balancing factors were optimized the production runs lasted for 100 ns. ALl MD simulations were run with Gromacs 4.6.

All EEMD simulations were repeated four times with different initial velocities and configurations (generated by running the initial NVT simulations at 330 K, 350 K and 400 K). All reported values are the mean of these four independent simulations.
